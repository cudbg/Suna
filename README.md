# Suna: Scalable Causal Confounder Discovery over Relational Data

This is an open-source implementation of the VLDB 2025 paper, Suna: scalable causal confounder discovery in relational datasets.

## Quick Start

For a runnable example, open the Jupyter notebook at **`dataprofile/demo.ipynb`**.  
It walks through the end-to-end Suna workflow on a small sample dataset.

## Current Limitations & Roadmap

This release assumes *equi-joins* and does **not** perform automatic data integration.  
Weâ€™re currently working on an end-to-end dataset search system to support richer join conditions.
